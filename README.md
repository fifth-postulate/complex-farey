# Complex Farey
The [_Farey sequence_][wikipedia:farey] of order `n` is

> the sequence of completely reduced fractions, between 0 and 1, which when in lowest terms have denominators less than or equal to `n`, arranged in order of increasing size.

They have various interesting properties. Among them that the `n+1` Farey sequence can be constructed from the `n` Farey sequence by taking [mediant][wikipedia:mediant].

This repository investigates a similar construction when played in the complex plane.
